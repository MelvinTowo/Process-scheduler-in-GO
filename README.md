# Process-scheduler-in-GO

The main.go file is in the Project1 dirctory

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This Process Scheduler helps with implementation of SJF, RR, FCFS and SJF Priority. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Scheduler is written in GO and only needs a `GO run` command followed by an example folder in CSV format to run the process scheduler

----------------------------------------------------------------------

All functions have been implemented called and only task required is to run the main file and check the outputs of the scheduler! 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SJF, RR and SJF priority were made by Melvin Towo!
